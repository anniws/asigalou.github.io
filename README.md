Hi there! I am postdoc at the [Microbial Systems Biology Lab](https://msb-lab.github.io/en/) which is hosted in [IPLA](https://www.ipla.csic.es/en/inicio-en/) (part of [CSIC](https://www.csic.es/en)), in Spain Oviedo. 

I work with mathematical models applied to physical systems. During my PhD with with Richard Mann I worked on the evolution of sociality in social decision-making. Now, I am working on the evolution of microbial populations.

I have a MEng in Mechanical engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, an MSc in Applied Mathematical Sciences from Heriot-Watt University, and a PhD in Statistics from the University of Leeds. I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate modules in Statistics in the University of Leeds.
